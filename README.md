I've developed a comprehensive habit tracking application that allows users to create, track, and visualize their daily habits. The application features a modular architecture with separate components for different functionalities, ensuring code maintainability and readability.

The habit tracker uses local storage for data persistence, allowing users to maintain their habit history between sessions. The application features a clean, intuitive interface with thoughtful animations and a responsive design that works across all device sizes. The dark/light mode toggle enhances user experience by allowing customization based on preference or lighting conditions.
